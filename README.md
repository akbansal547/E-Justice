# eJustice

**eJustice** is a small project I made which gives fair and quick decisions based on what both sides say. It's like a chatbot judge who listens to the victim and defendant and then gives a decision using IPC laws.

## 🧠 About

In my country India, court cases take many years. Many people don't get justice on time. I wanted to make something that can help in giving fast and fair judgement just by analysing what both sides are saying. So I made this.

## ⚙️ How it works

* You write what the victim said
* Then what the accused says
* Then it tells you a verdict by checking IPC laws and human emotion also
* It also gives voice output and a verdict screen

---

## ✨ Features

* Easy to use interface
* Voice speaks the judgement
* Download PDF of the verdict
* Small splash animation before the screen
* Two buttons after result – one for download and one for retry
* Looks at both side points before making any decision

## 🧪 How to run

1. Just open the `index.html` file in your browser
2. Add victim and defendant statements
3. Click the button and wait few seconds
4. Result will come on screen
